        Pilots don’t need generic fitness advice. You need structure built around duty days,
        hotel gyms, fatigue management, and irregular schedules. This is where performance starts.

            <p>
              The <strong>Black Box Code Coaching Program</strong> is built for pilots who want
              more than a quick reset — they want a body and protocol that actually matches the
              responsibility of their job.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A body that can handle long duty days without falling apart.</li>
              <li>Fatigue-proof performance in the flight deck.</li>
              <li>Hotel-gym training that’s designed for real-world overnights.</li>
              <li>A simple, repeatable nutrition system for travel days.</li>
              <li>Accountability built around aviation schedules — not 9–5 life.</li>

        <h2>What Is The Black Box Code?</h2>
        <p>
          Your aircraft records every action. So does your body.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          The Black Box Code is a performance protocol built for pilots who demand more from
          themselves — in strength, discipline, and how they show up in the cockpit.
